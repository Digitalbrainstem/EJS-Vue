# EJS-Vue

Provides Vue highlighting within ejs files.

## Trouble Shooting

If for some reason highlighting is not working. You may need to set your file.assositation for .ejs to "html". Recommend having the following extention as well. [EJS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support). More information can be find in the change log of EJS Language Support.
